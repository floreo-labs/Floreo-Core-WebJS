# Capstone Advice

## From Pursuit Staff
#### Teamwork makes the dream work
The product will only be as strong as the team.
A good leader doesn’t do the best work, they help their team do their best work.

#### Measure twice, cut once
Planning and organization are key to prevent duplication of work and headaches down the line.

#### The struggle is real
We will provide as many guardrails as possible but rest assured, Capstone will be a struggle.
Your team will face challenges much more independently than you have before.

## From Alumni
* “Get the kernel/core/MVP version of your idea done and working first. _then_ add features. don’t try to do too much at first.”

* “It's corny and obvious, but try to have fun. When you and your team are enjoying yourselves, you will produce higher quality code.”

* “You will have issues within your team, but handle them internally. I guarantee you will resolve them & definitely be strong. Also set time aside to REVIEW code with each other ”

* “Don’t focus on “winning”, make something you’d enjoy making/using”

* “When you're having a problem or stuck, don't keep it to yourself. Let your team know. Pair program with each other to avoid bottlenecks.”

* “Stick to what's been assigned to you. If you want to do more, then run it by the team first.”

* “Pace yourselves. Breaks are okay. Set realistic, attainable daily goals.”
