# Pursuit Core Capstone Project

Your capstone project is a creative, polished, 10+ weeks long group project where you get to build a Full-Stack Web Application from the ground up. For the vast majority of Pursuit alumni, their capstone project has represented the single most important, technically complete and impressive project they have ever built. 

Professionally Capstone is a well rounded experience, you will get to work with volunteers who are professional developers, in fact they will be your mentors. Capstone will teach you not only how to work in a group setting but also, project management, how to prioritize tasks, how address and resolve conflict as well as sharpen your communication skills. You wanna keep these lessons in mind because you will most likely get asked about them in behavioral interviews at tech companies.

All of this makes your Capstone project an great asset on your portfolio, resume and LinkedIn profile.

## Objectives
#### Technical Mastery
You will create a polished, technically impressive project.

#### Professional Skills
You will get more comfortable in a team setting and with workplace skills. You’ll hone your narrative and presentation skills in front of audience - both self- and product-narrative.

#### Tech Fluency
You will boost your ability to build, ship, and pitch a product.

## Capstone Phases
Roughly capstone has four phases. The timelines for these phases will look different for each individual class.

1. Ideation
2. Wireframing & App Proposal.
3. Prototype
4. MVP → Technical Showcase
5. Polished MVP & Deployment → Demo Day

#### Technical Showcase
Technical showcase comes after **MVP** and is an event where tech and architecture is the focus. Engineers from top tech companies get invited to see your projects and give you technical feedback to improve apps. All groups participate in this event.

#### Demo Day
Demo Day comes after **Polished MVP & Deployment**. The focus of the event is presentation and demoing of your app from a user perspective, with a focus on market and product feedback.
Attended by top executives, investors and professionals from the tech sector as well as family and friends. Will include all qualifying groups.

## App Requirements
* Front-end App built with React.
* Persist data to a backend built with Express.js and PostgreSQL
* Create an attractive and intuitive user interface that demonstrates an engaging user experience, 
* Backend includes user authentication with Passport.js
* Deployed to Heroku as a Full-Stack App
* Documentation. Project well-formatted README.md that explains project thoroughly, including user stories, backend routes architecture, DB Schema, and screenshots or animated images as needed.
* Demonstrate proficient Git workflow. This includes feature branches, frequent commits w/meaningful messages, etc.
* Clean JavaScript code. This includes naming conventions, DRY code, code formatting and indentation as well as project file structures.

## Best Practices
### Daily Stand-ups <sup>[1]</sup>
* All team members.
* Usually at the beginning of the day.
* No more than 15 minutes. Standing up helps keep the meeting short.
* **Purpose**: Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. It's not a detailed status meeting. The tone should be light and fun, but informative. Have each team member answer the following questions:

  * What did I complete yesterday?
  * What will I work on today?
  * Am I blocked by anything?
  * There's an implicit accountability in reporting what work you completed yesterday in front of your peers. No one wants to be the team member who is constantly doing the same thing and not making progress. 
* **Pro Tip**:
Some teams use timers to keep everyone on track. Others toss a ball across the team to make sure everyone's paying attention. Many distributed teams use videoconferencing or group chat to close the distance gap. Your team is unique. Your stand up should be, too!

### Sprint Planning <sup>[1]</sup>
* At the beginning of a sprint. Sprints can be one or two weeks long. For capstone one week is recommended. 
* One hour long for one week long sprint.
* **Purpose**: Sprint planning sets up the entire team for success throughout the sprint. Coming into the meeting, the team will prioritize to-dos or tasks. Each item is discussed, and the group collectively estimates the effort involved. The development team will then make a sprint forecast outlining how much work the team can complete from the product backlog. That body of work then becomes the sprint to-do list or backlog.
* **Pro tip**: Use the sprint planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done. Encourage team members to sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks that come into the sprint. Foster discussions and gather consensus on the plan of action. Effective planning significantly increases the team's chances of success meeting the commitments of the sprint. 

### Sprint Iteration Demo & Review
* At end of sprint
* About 6 minutes long 
* Before the entire classroom on Wednesdays 7-8pm
* **Purpose**: Iteration review is a time to showcase the work of the team. This is the time for the team to celebrate their accomplishments, demonstrate work finished within the iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders. Remember, work should be fully demonstrable and meet the team's quality bar to be considered complete and ready to showcase in the review.
* **Example**: This sprint our goals were A, B, and C.  We accomplished A and B, but hit a blocker on C. Here’s our demo of feature B.
* **In the industry**
  * About 30-60 minutes long
  * They can be in a casual format like "demo Fridays", or in a more formal meeting structure.
