- By Whom: [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich)
- Why: Netscape Navigator wanted to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms. They had to make the web more attractive and interactive. At the time that could be accomplished with Java and Netscape wanted to create a language prototype that could complement Java.
