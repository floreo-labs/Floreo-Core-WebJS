# Pair Programming

During your time at Pursuit you will regularly practice the art of pair programming. 
Pair programming is when you and a partner work on some code together. 

### How it works: 

Each of you should take turns switching between the Navigator and the Driver role. 
The Navigator should NOT be coding. The Navigator should be leading and giving directions on the code that should be written, and the Driver should be the only one working the keys and mouse. The Driver should be the one coding what the Navigator tells them too. 

This does NOT mean that the Navigator should be telling the Driver specifically what to write; instead they should be articulating their thoughts on how to proceed and the Driver should be translating those thoughts into code. 

A good Navigator sounds like: “Let’s declare a variable that can track our vowel count and then loop through the string. If the character in the string is a vowel, then we can increment the count.”

A bad Navigator sounds like: “Okay, so let vowelCount equal sign 0. Next line. For open parenthesis, let i equal sign 0, semicolon i less than string dot length, semicolon, i plus plus, close parenthesis, open curly bracket…” etc, I can’t go on writing like that, you shouldn’t talk like that either. 

It is super important that both the Driver and the Navigator understand what it is that they are working on and the goal they are trying to achieve. There should always be talk about strategy and approach. It is vital that both people are on the same page. If you’re unsure of the approach the Navigator is saying, ask questions, clarify. The expectation is that both of you understand 100% of every single line of code that is written. 

You should switch roles approximately every 15 minutes. While learning it can be helpful to set a timer for each switch. The [https://helper-queue.netlify.app/](https://helper-queue.netlify.app/) has a timer that you can use. Using the timer will help build structure and remove any awkwardness about when the roles should be switched. 

### Scenarios:

All scenarios are a gift. Don’t worry if you are the better or worse programmer of the two. It really DOESN’T matter and will most likely switch often as you program with every member of the class. Both people will have the opportunity to learn and improve from the other. If you are the weaker programmer, use this opportunity to learn as much as possible. Ask questions and don’t let your partner get away with anything. Make sure that you understand ALL the code that is written. If you are the stronger programmer, this is your opportunity to help your fellow classmate, and learn by explaining / teaching. Teaching is one of the greatest things you can do to learn something better. It cements and solidifies your knowledge.

### Benefits:

Pair programming is like any skill; you will need to practice it to get better. It will likely feel very tough to do at the start of the program (you’ll be tempted to navigate and drive at the same time), but you will get more comfortable with it and improve. It is important to practice this skill because you will need to be able to comfortably communicate your code on a high level as well as regularly translate discussed code / concepts into working code. Pairing will allow for quicker and easier dissemination of information (if you see your pair do something like a shortcut, ask how). Pairing will help you build a rapport with your teammates and thus build classroom culture. Pairing helps keep both parties focused on the task at hand (no email or reddit), and helps people catch bugs earlier. Pair programming is also something that is done at many companies. These are just a few examples of why Pairing is an important skill to practice. 

### Tips:
* In person, pairs should sit beside each other. It can be helpful to have two monitors. 
* In a remote universe you can take turns sharing your screen as the Driver. VS Code [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share) extension can also be used. 
* Be patient. Treat your pair the way you’d like to be treated. 
* Fight the urge to “show” instead of “tell” your thoughts. 
* Adhere to the Driver, Navigator roles. 
* Use a timer to set a rhythm and make for clear transitions. 
* Don’t check your phone, email, reddit, etc.. Be an active participant.
