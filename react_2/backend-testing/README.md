# API or Backend Testing
The API Testing we will be doing here today is considered a form of Integration Testing because we are testing the contract between our route handlers, queries and database. And making sure they work well together in turn assuring us that our backend works as we expect it.

## Objectives
By the end of this session you should be able to:
* Explain what is integration test is and how it compares to a unit test
* Know how to test a GET endpoint using supertest
* Know how to test a POST endpoint sending data to the server using supertest
* Setup backend testing for any of your backend projects
* Talk about the pitfalls of sharing state between tests

## Backend to be tested
Today we will be testing the [UserAuth & Notes](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Testing-Starter) Backend Application that handles users and notes. Some feature of this backend include:

* User Authentication:
  * A user can signup with username and password
  * A user can login
  * A user can logout
* Notes
  * Unauthenticated users can post anonymous notes.
  * Any unauthenticated user can retrieve all public notes.
  * Authenticated users can add a note.
  * Authenticated users can get the notes they have added.
  * Anonymous notes are public by default.

## Setup

1. Clone starter Backend App and install dependencies:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Testing-Starter.git
  cd Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Testing-Starter
  npm install
  ```

2. Install dev dependencies

  ```
  npm install -D jest jest-extended @types/jest supertest 
  ```

  * [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) - Our testing framework
  * [`jest-extended`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended) - Provides additional handy matchers
  * [`@types/jest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jest) - Jest Typescript Typings. This is nice to give use intellisense/autocomplete for jest
  * [`supertest`](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) - HTTP client for making HTTP assertions. You can think of this as the `axios` for `testing`. 

3. Create and Save `jest.config.js` a the root of your project

  ```js
  // Set test database DATABASE_URL for testing so that our development database 
  // does not get reset in between test
  process.env.DATABASE_URL = "postgres://localhost:5432/users_notes_api_test_db"

  module.exports = {
    setupFilesAfterEnv: ["jest-extended"],
    testEnvironment: "node"
  }
  ```
  This sets the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` to our database `users_notes_api_test_db` which is the database that we want to user for our tests and which we will create next.
  This file also ensures that we get the additional matchers from `jest-extended` and sets the jest test environment config to be `node` (default is `jsdom`)

4. Set/add `test` script to `package.json` as shown here:

  ```
  "test": "jest --runInBand --watch"
  ```

 This makes sure that our tests run serially (`--runInBand`). Normally for unit testing Jest will run tests in parallel for speed and efficiently but since our tests will share the same database if one test modifies a record another might utilize the results of the previous test or conflict with it giving us have hard to debug issues. `--watch` will keep jest running so that we get hot test reload when we change a source file or test file.

5. Usually you will have two databases one for testing (`*_test_db`) and another one for development manual manual testing (`*_dev_db`). When one gets reset or reseeded you don't want the other to be modified.

Create a new `test` database and seed it for the first time.
```
createdb users_notes_api_test_db
psql -f db/seed.sql -d users_notes_api_test_db 
```

Its a good idea to spin our `development` database as well too so that we don't forget later
```
createdb users_notes_api_dev_db
psql -f db/seed.sql -d users_notes_api_dev_db 
```

6. Create a `resetDb.js` file with the following content. Save it to the `db/` directory
  ```js
  /*
  * resetDb.js
  * File used to reset and reseed database tables when testing 
  */

  const { execSync } = require('child_process')

  const SEED_FILE_PATH = __dirname + "/seed.sql"

  // Having into account that DATABASE_URL = "postgres://localhost:5432/users_notes_api_test_db"
  // was set in jest.config.js
  const DATABASE_NAME = process.env.DATABASE_URL.split('/')[3]

  const resetDb = () => {
    execSync(`psql -d ${DATABASE_NAME} -f ${SEED_FILE_PATH}`)
  }

  module.exports = resetDb;
  ```

  This file calls `psql` which will execute our seed file `-f ${SEED_FILE_PATH}` in the context of our database `-d ${DATABASE_NAME}`. Note that our seed file should not include the lines to `DROP`/`CREATE` a database or connect to it.

  We will use this file to spin up and down our database tables in between tests. We want to avoid our tests using shared state (global variables, database data, etc) as much as possible.

## Hands On
### Explore the Backend to be Tested

Once you have cloned the starter App take 15 minutes to read its [README Doc](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Testing-Starter) and familiarize yourself with the endpoints and requests. Also take a look at the files, make sure there is nothing surprising or confusing about it. Try a few requests with Postman.

### Our First Test. `/api/notes/public` retrieves all notes
Let us test endpoints or routes that do not require a user to be logged in first. We will test that a client can retrieve all public  notes when a `GET` request to `/api/notes/public` is made.

1. Create a `__tests__` folder at the root of your project.
2. Create a `notes.test.js` test file
3. Add the following content
```js
const request = require('supertest')
const app = require('../app')
const reqAgent = request.agent(app)
const resetDb = require('../db/resetDb');

beforeEach(() => {
  resetDb()
})

afterAll(() => {
  resetDb()
})

describe('/api/notes endpoints', () => {
  test('All public notes are retrieved', async () => {
    const { status, body } = await reqAgent.get('/api/notes/public')
    expect(status).toBe(200)
    expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])
    expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
    expect(body.msg).toMatch(/retrieved all public notes/i)

    const notes = body.payload
    expect(notes).toBeArrayOfSize(2) // There are only 2 public notes in our database

    // Sample and test values of one note
    expect(notes[0]).toContainAllKeys(['id', 'created_at', 'user_id', 'text', 'is_public'])
    expect(new Date(notes[0].created_at)).toBeValidDate()
    expect(notes[0].id).toBeNumber()
    expect(notes[0].user_id).toBeNumber()
    expect(notes[0].text).toBeString()
    expect(notes[0].is_public).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

#### Explanation
* `beforeEach` will execute the callback provided after each test. In this case the callback invokes `resetDb()` to reset our database after each test. Remember that we don't want to share state (data, variables etc) between tests as possible. Read the `beforeEach` docs [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#beforeeachfn-timeout)
* `afterAll`. After all the tests make sure our database is reset and does not contain any test data.
* `reqAgent.get('/api/notes/public')`. Is what will fire the request to our our app's endpoint. Kind of like `axios` but for testing. You can see that `reqAgent` is made by importing `request` from `supertest` and creating an agent by passing in our app.
* `const { status, body }` is destructuring the status and body of the response so that we can make assertions on them.
* `expect(status).toBe(200)`. It reads pretty easily doesn't it?. We are expecting that for this request the response `status` was a successful `200`
* `expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])`. In this way you can check that your response object is returning all the keys that you expect.
* Then you can make assertions on the values of the response body properties like so:
```js
  expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
  expect(body.msg).toMatch(/retrieved all public notes/i)
```
* The rest is us sampling and checking the response `payload` property. For easier readability we save `body.payload` in a variable `notes` (`const notes = body.payload`). For this request the payload will contain an array of note objects. In this case we should get 2 notes because that's the number of notes we start with in our `seed.sql` file. We also take a look at the first note and assert that it has properties `id`, `created_at`, `user_id`, `text` and `is_public`. Lastly we assert that those properties have the expected values like, expecting that the note `text` property is a string (`expect(notes[0].text).toBeString()`)

### Your turn. `/api/users` retrieves all users
1. Create a `users.test.js` file inside `__tests__/`
2. Write a test that verifies that when a request to `/api/users` is made all the users are returned.
    * **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE CODE**. Build muscle memory.
    * Make sure you have the correct `require`s and setup.
    * This will be a similar and even simpler test than the previous one.
    * Implement your test:
  ```js
  describe('/users endpoints', () => {
    test('GET to /api/users retrieves all users', async () => {
      // Your testing code goes here
    })
  })
  ```
<details>
  <summary>Compare your approach to this solution. </summary>

How does yours differ from this? Ask any questions came up?
```js
// users.test.js 
const request = require('supertest')
const app = require('../app')
const reqAgent = request.agent(app)
const resetDb = require('../db/resetDb');

afterEach(() => {
  resetDb()
})

afterAll(() => {
  resetDb()
})

describe('/users endpoints', () => {
  test('GET to /api/users retrieves all users', async () => {
    const { status, body } = await reqAgent.get('/api/users')
    expect(status).toBe(200)
    expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])

    const users = body.payload
    expect(users).toBeArrayOfSize(2) // Our seed file inserts two users. So we have 2 users in our database.

    // Sample one user and assert property values
    const user = users[0]
    expect(user).toContainAllKeys(['id', 'username'])
    expect(user.id).toBeNumber()
    expect(user.username).toBe('JonSnow') // JonSnow is the first user in our database seed file
  })
})
```
</details>

### Test that a new anonymous note can be added by posting to `/api/notes/anonymous` 
Ok, we tested retrieving data from our API. How do we test adding/posting data?
Take a look at the following code:
```js
test('A new anonymous note can be posted', async () => {

  let newNote = {
    text: "This is an anon note. Not associated with any user",
  }

  const { status, body } = await reqAgent.post('/api/notes/anonymous').send(newNote)
  expect(status).toBe(200)
  expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])
  expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
  expect(body.msg).toMatch(/added new anonymous note/i)

  const note = body.payload
  expect(note).toContainAllKeys(['id', 'created_at', 'user_id', 'text', 'is_public'])
  expect(note.id).toBeNumber()
  expect(note.user_id).toBe(null)
  expect(note.text).toBe(newNote.text)
  expect(note.is_public).toBe(true)
  expect(new Date(note.created_at)).toBeValidDate()
})
```
#### Explanation
* To post/send data we use `reqAgent.post(url).send(data)`. Compare to example when getting data instead.
* It's important to never forget the `await` for asynchronous code. If we do our assertions will fail
* Assert that our response has the expected keys and tha the values are what we expect, for instance we expect the `user_id` to be null because this is an anonymous note. We also expect the response note `text` property to be the same that we sent (`expect(note.text).toBe(newNote.text)`)

### Your turn. Test that a new user can be signed up by posting to `/api/auth/signup`
* We could do this in `users.test.js` but I recommend having a new file `auth.test.js` instead. `auth.test.js` will be for user authentication tests only.
* Create the `__tests__/auth.test.js` test file
* Make sure you have the correct `require`s and setup.
* This test involves sending/posting data just like our previous test.
* Assert that your response was successful by checking the status code and the payload similarly to our previous test. If in doubt try this request in Postman first.
* Implement your test
  ```js
  describe('/api/auth endpoints', () => {
    test('POST to /signup registers a user and sends user back along with success message', async () => {
      // Your testing code goes here
    })
  })
  ```
<details>
  <summary>Compare your approach to this solution. </summary>

How does yours differ from this? Ask any questions came up?
```js
// auth.test.js
const app = require('../app')
const request = require('supertest')
const resetDb = require('../db/resetDb')
const reqAgent = request.agent(app)

beforeEach(() => {
  resetDb()
})

afterAll(() => {
  resetDb()
})

describe('/api/auth endpoints', () => {
  test('POST to /signup registers a user and sends user back along with success message', async () => {
    const user = {
      username: 'TestUser837',
      password: "s3cr37"
    }

    const { status, body } = await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/signup').send(user)
    expect(status).toBe(200)
    expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])
    expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
    expect(body.msg).toMatch("User successfully signed up")
    expect(body.payload.username).toBe(user.username)
    expect(body.payload.id).toBeNumber()
    expect(body.payload.password).toBeUndefined() // Make sure password was not returned
  })
})
```
</details>

### Test POST to `/api/auth/login` logs in a user and sends back user along with success message
* Have in mind that you need to sign up a new user before you can log them in.
* Implement test:
  ```js
  test('POST to /login logs in a user and sends back user along with success message', async () => {})
  ```

<details style="margin-left: 2em">
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
test('POST to /login logs in a user and sends back user along with success message', async () => {

  const user = {
    username: 'otherUser1',
    password: "not_a_secret"
  }

  // Signup user first
  await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/signup').send(user)

  // Try to log in
  const { status, body } = await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/login').send(user)

  expect(status).toBe(200)
  expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])
  expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
  expect(body.msg).toMatch(/success/i)
  expect(body.payload.username).toBe(user.username)
  expect(body.payload.id).toBeNumber()
  expect(body.payload.password).toBeUndefined() // Make sure password was not returned
})
```
</details>

### Test GET to `/api/auth/logout` logs out the user currently logged in and sends success message 
To test logging out we need to sign up and login a new user before hand.

```js
test('GET to /logout logs out the user currently logged in and sends success message', async () => {

  const user = {
    username: 'oneMoreUser1',
    password: "not_a_secret"
  }

  await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/signup').send(user) // Signup user first
  await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/login').send(user) // Login user 

  // Try to Log out
  const { status, body } = await reqAgent.get('/api/auth/logout')

  expect(status).toBe(200)
  expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])
  expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
  expect(body.msg).toMatch(/success/i)
  expect(body.payload).toBe(null)
})
```

I this test failing? Why??. It is failing as a consequence of two things:
1. Our session storage is in memory, so when we reset our database with `resetDb` between every test users that we create on our tests are removed but if a user was logged-in a session remains active for that user even though the user is no longer in our database. When we make a new request, our backend will try to deserialize a user from the session but it wont find any in the database and it will crash sending a `500` status code.
2. We are sharing state between our tests in the form of a cookie. It turns out that `reqAgent` preserves cookies and cookies is how our backend keeps tracks of user sessions. In the previous test logging-in a user returns a cookie that `reqAgent` will hold on to, that tests passes and when Jest moves to the next `resetDb` gets called (remember `beforeEach`). Now on this current test, when we make a request to sign-up a new user (it actually doesn't matter what request we make next, it will fail) `reqAgent` will send the cookie it has from the previous test and our server will crash because the user that cookie belonged to is no longer in our database and Passport's deserializing fails.

Proof of the previous points is that if you run this test with `test.only()` instead of just `test()`, the test passes because it runs with a blank slate in terms of cookies. `test.only` causes only this test to run and the others are skipped.

**⚠️ Note** 
When you have a test that passes with `test.only()` but it doesn't pass when run with others, or vise versa it passes when run with others but it fails with `test.only()` that means your tests are influencing each other because you are sharing some kind of state between them. Get rid of the shared state. 

##### Fixing this test 
Let's get rid of the shared state for this test. At the top of your file make sure that after each test you logout the user

```js
afterEach(async () => {
  await reqAgent.get('/api/auth/logout') // Logout user, we don't want sessions being kept in between tests
})
```

### Test POST to `/api/notes` adds a new note that belongs to the currently logged in user

```js
  test('POST to /notes adds a new note that belongs to the currently logged in user', async () => {

    // ARRANGE
    let user = {
      username: 'testUser2',
      password: 'drowssap'
    }

    await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/signup').send(user) // Signup new user
    const res = await reqAgent.post('/api/auth/login').send(user) // Login new user
    let loggedInUser = res.body.payload

    let note = {
      text: "I'm happy",
      is_public: false
    }

    // ACT
    const { status, body } = await reqAgent.post('/api/notes').send(note)

    // ASSERT
    expect(status).toBe(200)
    expect(body).toContainAllKeys(['err', 'msg', 'payload'])
    expect(body.err).toBeFalse()
    expect(body.msg).toMatch(/added new note/i)

    const newNote = body.payload
    expect(newNote).toContainAllKeys(['id', 'created_at', 'user_id', 'text', 'is_public'])
    expect(newNote.id).toBeNumber()
    expect(newNote.user_id).toBe(loggedInUser.id)
    expect(newNote.text).toBe(note.text)
    expect(newNote.is_public).toBe(note.is_public)
    expect(new Date(newNote.created_at)).toBeValidDate()
  })
```
#### Explanation
* Note how all tests have the three **A**s: **Arrange**, **Act** & **Assert**
* First we we sign up and log in a new user
* Then we send a new note. Because `reqAgent` has the cookie of the logged in user when we add a new note our backend knows who the owner of that note will be and it[ uses the currently logged in user id for the `user_id` for the note. For more see route handlers for [`POST /api/notes`](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Testing-Starter/blob/tested-app/routes/notes.js#L24) in the notes router.
* We assert that we got a response with the expected keys and values

## Exercises
Implement the following tests:

* GET to /notes/mine retrieves the currently logged in user notes. Compare your solution to [this one on the `tested-app` branch](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Testing-Starter/blob/1017c01a5c27c75eb852dcdb284bdc0059ea0a72/__tests__/notes.test.js#L96)
* GET to /notes/mine when no user is logged-in does not retrieve notes and returns auth error. Compare your solution to the one on the `tested-app` branch of the starter app. 
* POST to /notes with no user logged in returns auth error and prevents adding a new note.
* GET to /auth/isUserLoggedIn returns the currently logged in user
