# Capstone Scrum Ceremonies

An introduction to how to organize your team during capstone.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why companies use systems like Agile
- Explain what ceremonies are and how to use them in development

## Framing and Background

Development is hard.  There is a lot of ambiguity in development work and it can often be challenging to know how long it will take to build a feature. It is important for companies to be able to estimate when development work will be completed so other parts of the organization can plan around it. For example, the marketing team might want to buy advertisements right before the launch of a new feature.  To do so, they'll want to have a good estimate of when the feature will be built and ready to ship.

One of the main strategies that companies use to understand how long things will take to build and monitor development work is called **Agile**.  Agile refers to type of project management that divides work into units called **sprints** and introduces a set of meetings, called **ceremonies**.  For your capstone project, you should implement the *Daily Standup*, *Sprint Planning*, and *Sprint Retrospective* ceremonies, and have one ceremony at the beginning to create *User Stories* as part of your initial proposal.

## User Stories

A user story is the smallest unit of work for your team.  An example of a user story is:

> As a user, I can create a new account using an email and a password.

A user story may have subtasks that break down into specific development work.  For example, in the user story above, you might make subtasks for building a React login component and configuring Firebase Auth.

At the very beginning of your project, you should create **tickets** that represent all of the user stories that you will need to do.  Put all of these tickets into a column called your **Backlog**.


## Sprints

A **Sprint** is a two-week period of work connected to specific objectives.  A sprint begins with a Sprint Planning meeting where you set your objectives and bring in specific tickets (Trello cards).  During a sprint, you'll meet daily with your team to review progress and discuss any challenges.  At the end of a sprint, you'll demo the new features you completed, then spend some time reviewing the whole sprint with your team.


## Sprint Planning

At the beginning of each sprint, you should take some tickets out of your backlog and drag them into a new column representing your sprint.  The picture from Trello below illustrates this flow:

## Standups

You should meet with your whole team at least once a day during your sprint.  This meeting should be no longer than 10 minutes and should focus on a very specific set of questions:

1. What work did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What am I planning on working on today?
3. Are there any obstacles that will prevent me from accomplishing what I'm working on?

You should not go into depth on any topic in this meeting.  If you do want to have a followup conversation about a technical issue, you should table the topic, end the meeting, then meet separately with anyone who you want to collaborate with.

## Sprint Demos (Sprint Reviews)

At the end of each sprint, you will demo your accomplishments to a broader audience.  In companies, these demos are attended by team members from Design, Marketing, Sales, and Product teams to better understand the current work teams are doing and to ask questions and provide feedback.  These demos should not be full run-throughs of your application, but should be focused on the specific features / user stories that you completed during the sprint.  A sprint demo should run about 5 - 10 minutes with some time at the end for questions.

## Sprint Retrospectives

At the end of each sprint, you should meet with your team to review your progress during the sprint.  Focus on the following topics:

1. What went well this sprint?
1. What didn't go so well this sprint?
1. What specific actions should we commit to during our next sprint?
